Global aim is to create an image hosting that would be targeting the sharing if images as accessible and wide as possible - 
 with not only sharing between the members of the service itself - bu also all the populat social networks, 
 also - options to generate the QR code for the image link.

- DONE - change the scheme of modal windows render - so there would not be all the modals opened at once, even invisible.
- work on the keyboard accessibility - tabIndex feature for all interactive elements with all the styles needed.
- add input filter to the group menu in gallery so that user can choose groups of images by tags.
- CURRENT - create the scheme of sharing images. The front end part was created, also save of the new openedTo list in one image. 
  Need to create methods on front and back for editing the corresponding User objects userOpenedToImages property - 
  for a single image openTo list edit as well as for multiple images in group mode.
- generating QR code for the image link.


BUGS work

 - on the backend - make a GOOD duplication-proof way for creating temporary filenames for uploaded images.
 - handle duplication resilience in tags and openedToUsers lists - in share components especially.
