Global aim is to create an image hosting that would make the sharing of images as accessible and wide as possible - 
 with not only sharing between the members of the service itself - bu also all the popular social networks, 
 also - options to generate the QR code for the image link.
 
- swipe navigation for mobile devices.
- remove spinner when there are no images in gallery.
- add description and title to images.
- random background images for auth views -  from public galleries
- create a text-to-image part pointing mechanism - best of all as a library, npm package (so also I would learn how to make one).
  It would create arrow or line type pointers from special parts of text to specific parts of image.
- desktop modal image modification. Make the nonimage part closable - so only the image itself and back - forth navigation would
  be visible.
- sort by likes number.

BUGS work
 - handle duplication resilience in tags and openedToUsers lists - in share components especially.
