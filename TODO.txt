Global aim is to create an image hosting that would make the sharing of images as accessible and wide as possible - 
 with not only sharing between the members of the service itself - bu also all the popular social networks, 
 also - options to generate the QR code for the image link.
 
- ModalImage Refactor!!!
- refactor types, where it is possible - create them from the MST models via Instance.
  It would create arrow or line type pointers from special parts of text to specific parts of image.
- add Viber and Telegram share, maybe FB messenger.
- sort by likes number.
- modify filter - so it would look also by the title. So it makes the search by the title and tags.
