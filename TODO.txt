Global aim is to create an image hosting that would make the sharing of images as accessible and wide as possible - 
 with not only sharing between the members of the service itself - bu also all the popular social networks, 
 also - options to generate the QR code for the image link.

- CURRENT - make everything mobule friendly, all  that I've got here right now.
- add sharing of the image as the link on the site page of the image - and as wht link to the image on hosting.
- generating QR code for the image link.
- add sharing through social networks - FB, Twitter, Instagram etc.
- pack all the svg icons into one sprite.
- add description and title to images.
- random background images for auth views -  from public galleries
