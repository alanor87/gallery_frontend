Global aim is to create an image hosting that would make the sharing of images as accessible and wide as possible - 
 with not only sharing between the members of the service itself - bu also all the popular social networks, 
 also - options to generate the QR code for the image link.
 
- CURRENT - create a text-to-image part pointing mechanism - best of all as a library, npm package (so also I would learn how to make one).
  It would create arrow or line type pointers from special parts of text to specific parts of image.
- add Viber and Telegram share, maybe FB messenger.
- sort by likes number.
- modify filter - so it would look also by the title. So it makes the search by the title and tags.
