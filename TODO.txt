Global aim is to create an image hosting that would be targeting the sharing if images as accessible and wide as possible - 
 with not only sharing between the members of the service itself - bu also all the populat social networks, 
 also - options to generate the QR code for the image link.

- CURRENT - make small images for the gallery - and load big ones only on the modal images view.
- remove openedTo from data being sent to publicGallery.
- make modal window unclosable while the spinner inside of it is spinning.
- make big separate images view, with all the bells and whistles.
- add sharing of the image as the link on the site  page of the image - and as wht link to the image on hosting.
- generating QR code for the image link.
- add shar8ng through social networks - FB, Twitter, Instagram etc.
- pack all the svg icons into one sprite.

BUGS work
 - fix token validation issue when requesting a simgle image from backend from publicGallery - in this case there should not be token validation.
 - handle duplication resilience in tags and openedToUsers lists - in share components especially.
